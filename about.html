				<h3><p>What is cephei.us?</p></h3>
				<p>cephei.us is a realtime music discovery platform. Named after the contact binary star VW Cephei, the website is intended to help the community easily find new music that other users want to share with others. It is as easy as pressing post and putting in the Youtube link to your favorite song.</p>
				<h3><p>How was cephei.us made?</p></h3>
				<p>cephei.us was actually mostly made by <a href="http://jimmyjia.me" target="_blank">me</a> (idea and basic code) in around one day. I had an idea while in class and took it home that night and stayed up til the sun rose to create the first working version of the site. Since then, I've been working on updates as ideas come and as time permits.</p>
				<h3><p>What is coming up?</p></h3>
				<p>I'm currently planning a lot of new features that I'll be designing and implementing in these coming months. Since I am a full time student, that takes priority over my personal projects. Some examples of things I'm looking
				into including are user authentication through Facebook (don't worry, we won't post on your wall or use your information for anything besides idenity verificiton)</p>
				<h3><p>Technologies Used?</p></h3>
				<p>Technologies used are HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript  and is made possible thanks to the <a href="http://firebase.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a> API and <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube.</a><br><br>Credit is also due to:
